- People who use computers for extended periods often experience issues such as tech neck.

- This problem occurs as users lean their faces closer to the computer screen while focusing intensely on their tasks.

- To address this, it is essential to prevent the face from getting too close to the screen and to perform stretching exercises at regular intervals.

- As a solution, during our hackathon project, we developed a web service that utilizes a webcam to monitor if the user's face remains too close to the screen for a certain duration. If this happens, an alarm sounds or a custom stretching video is played.

- We used the vertical distance between the shoulder line and the eyes to calculate the distance between the user's face and the screen. If this distance decreases below a certain threshold, it is considered a tech neck situation, and a count is triggered.

- We designed the system to allow users to adjust this threshold distance.

- Additionally, users can access data stored on the server via the webcam to understand their computer usage habits better.
