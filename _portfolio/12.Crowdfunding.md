- **Crowdfunding Design Product Project**
  - **Project Overview**
    - This project involves creating actual design products and selling them through crowdfunding.

  - **Background**
    - During the planning stage, South Korea was experiencing difficulties with vacations due to COVID-19, leading to widespread feelings of depression.
    - The aim was to create design products that evoke thoughts of summer vacations, particularly focusing on the beach, to uplift spirits.

  - **Product Development**
    - Using CNC as a professional processing equipment, candle holders were crafted by sculpting the shape of the seaside with wood and pouring resin into silicone molds.
    - Laser engraving was used to showcase effects similar to writing on a sandy beach.
