- Restaurants and cafes with barrier-free facilities for the physically disabled are rare in Korea

- Even that, there is no map containing information about restaurants or cafes with barrier-free facilities, making it difficult for people with physical disabilities to use it

- In order to reduce the inequality caused by the absence of such information, we visited cafes or restaurants equipped with barrier-free facilities in our area and produced a barrier-free map with information about them

- As I used restaurants and cafes in a wheelchair, I recorded the convenience of movement, table height, passage width, and the presence or absence of toilets for the disabled on the map
