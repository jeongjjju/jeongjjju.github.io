- This is a project about creating actual design products and selling them through crowdfunding.

- At the time of planning this project, South Korea was in a situation where it was difficult to go on vacation due to COVID-19, and many people were feeling depressed as a result.

- Therefore, I wanted to create design products that evoke thoughts of summer vacations, specifically focusing on the beach, as a way to uplift spirits.

- Using CNC as a professional processing equipment, I crafted candle holders that sculpt the shape of the seaside by processing wood and pouring resin into silicone molds.

- Additionally, through laser engraving, I showcased effects similar to writing on a sandy beach.

- As a result, we achieved **sales that exceeded 200% of the target amount.**
