Teleoperation, the remote manual control of robots, is primarily used in high-precision and safety-critical environments such as surgery, space exploration, and deep-sea exploration. Despite being a widely utilized technology, teleoperation relies on human cognitive abilities, leading to significant cognitive load for operators. To address this challenge, we propose a concept of a VR teleoperation haptic system that combines biomechanical simulation and electrical muscle stimulation to provide force feedback in a lightweight, wearable form by mimicking natural force generation without the need for external actuators. Our system is divided into two main components: the physical simulation part, which calculates the joint torques to replicate forces from the manipulator, and the electrical stimulation part, which translates torques into muscle stimulations. Through this integration, we expect our system to bridge the gulf of execution and evaluation, reducing cognitive load and enhancing teleoperation performance. This paper aims to discuss the detailed framework of our system and potential future research directions.
