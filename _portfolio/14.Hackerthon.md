- **Tech Neck Prevention Web Service**
  - Developed a solution for tech neck during a hackathon project.
  - Monitors the user's face distance from the screen using a webcam.
  - Alerts the user with an alarm or plays a custom stretching video if the face is too close to the screen for a certain duration.
  - Calculates the face-to-screen distance using the vertical distance between the shoulder line and the eyes.
  - Triggers an alert if the distance falls below a set threshold, indicating a tech neck situation.
  - Allows users to adjust the threshold distance according to their preference.
  - Provides access to usage data stored on the server to help users understand their computer usage habits better.
