## üß≤ Project Overview

**Magneto** is a multimodal haptic system that augments paper interfaces with **force**, **vibration**, and **thermal feedback** using magnetic fields.

The system consists of lightweight magnetic patches made from **neodymium magnets** and **steel plates**, actuated through external **electromagnets** and **induction coils**. This enables rich tactile interaction on paper without embedding electronics directly into the sheet, preserving the flexibility and simplicity of paper.

Magneto supports various applications, including:
- **Augmented technical drawings** with vibration and heat
- **Interactive card games** using pitch rotation and feedback
- **Origami-based prototypes** enhanced with rotational haptics

Experimental evaluations confirm that Magneto's feedback falls within human perceptual thresholds, demonstrating its potential to bring dynamic interactivity to paper in educational, gaming, and prototyping contexts.
