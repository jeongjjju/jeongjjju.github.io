### 🔹 Motivation  
Human sign language interpretation services are often limited in availability. This project proposes an AI-based sign language translator to facilitate communication with hearing-impaired individuals.

### 🔹 System Overview  
We designed and implemented a **portable finger sign language translation device** that can connect to smartphones.  
It captures finger movements, translates them into voice output, and also interprets the counterpart's speech into animated finger gestures.
