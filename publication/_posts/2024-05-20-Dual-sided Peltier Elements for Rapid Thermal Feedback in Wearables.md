## 🧊 Project Overview

This paper introduces a motor-driven Peltier device designed to deliver immediate thermal sensations within extended reality (XR) environments.

The system incorporates eight motor-driven Peltier elements, facilitating swift transitions between warm and cool sensations by rotating preheated or cooled elements to opposite sides. A multi-layer structure, comprising aluminum and silicone layers, ensures user comfort and safety while maintaining optimal temperatures for thermal stimuli.

Time-temperature characteristic analysis demonstrates the system's ability to provide warm and cool sensations efficiently, with a dual-sided lifetime of up to 206 seconds at a 2V input.

Our system design is adaptable to various body parts and can be synchronized with corresponding visual stimuli to enhance the immersive sensation of virtual object interaction and information delivery.
