## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Overview

This paper proposes a haptic feedback framework for VR-based teleoperation by combining biomechanical simulation and electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). The aim is to reduce cognitive load and improve teleoperation efficiency by simulating joint torque through EMS without using heavy mechanical actuators.

The system is divided into two main parts:  
1) **PhySim**: Simulates the user's biomechanics to estimate required joint torques  
2) **EleStim**: Converts torque into personalized EMS intensity for realistic force feedback

The hardware integrates EMS electrodes with real-time motion capture and physical simulation using Unity and Nvidia PhysX. The device stimulates six muscles on the arm, enabling force feedback from remote manipulators.
